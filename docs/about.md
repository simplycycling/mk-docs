# About

Who is Rog? Who are any of us, really? What is the concept of self 
really about; is it just definition of the abstract?

Newp. Rog is a Systems Engineer, who took an unusual path to arrive at
his current position. Starting out as a musician with dreams of stardom,
with a detour into hating life as a truck driver, finally going back to 
school and acquiring some formal learning to go along with his self-taught
Linux knowledge.
