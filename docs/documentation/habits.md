# Habits

I didn't write this list, I saw it somewhere on the internet, and thought
it was a wonderful encapsulation of how I try to live. Maybe it will 
resonate with you the same way it did with me.

### Here are the habits I do every day.

Most important - I don't think about past or future. I think only about if I can do these habits today. I can control today.

I try to improve 1% each day on:

Physical health - sleeping, eating well, exercise (which might just 
mean...enough movement per day. It doesn't mean gym time).

Emotional health

* Improve friendships
    * Get rid of the people who put me down or make me feel bad about
     myself
    * Improve my own ability to hold onto my self-esteem rather than 
    outsourcing it to others. It's hard enough for other people to deal
     with their own self-esteem, let alone mine.
    * Love strangers
    * Love my family
    * Don't judge myself too harshly

* Mental health
    * Write down 10 ideas a day to exercise my idea muscle. The benefits 
   of this are enormous. I just sent ten ideas, for instance, to a $100 
   billion company that asked me for them. I build networks, make money,
    create opportunities, become creativity, because i write down 10 
    ideas (most of them horrible) every day on a waiter's pad.
    * Write, draw, create, in some way

* Spiritual health
    * Simply be grateful every day. Find something difficult to be 
    grateful for. Like a breakup. Or...like losing money.

* Financial Habits. The above are the most important habits. If I don't
 do those, I'll never succeed. I've seen this over and over. But there 
 are financial habits.
    * Never invest more than 2% of your net worth in any one thing. And 
  that includes downpayment on a house. Or college for kids. Or private
  investments. Or stocks.
    * When you invest in a private company...people is more important than
   idea or industry. Invest with A) someone who has been CEO before of a
   successful company and B) with co-investors who are smarter than you
   and C) in a demographic that is trending upwards.

* I keep the rest of my money in cash and I use it to invest in myself.
 I invest in myself with:
    * experiences
    * education
    * stories (I'll do anything for a good story)
    * Books. This isn't quite a financial habit so I split it out. Read a
  mix of non-fiction and fiction each day. It doesn't matter what you 
  learn. Don't stress it. You'll absorb.

Books are the way to get a lifetime worth of experiences in just a few 
days. And you can do that 100 times a year. So (let me do the math), 
that's like living 100 years in one year. Or something like that.

Oh! Another important habit.

Never, NEVER, blame someone else for your misfortune. That's similar to 
out-sourcing your self-esteem to someone else: a boss, a relationship, 
etc.
The only way someone invented cures, was by getting sick. Take 
responsibility for yourself, so you know the future cures. That's how 
you live longer and happier in every way.
