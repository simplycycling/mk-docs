### Résumé

**Current Position**, from January 27th, 2014 - current

Senior Systems Engineer - Viddler

Viddler is a video hosting company that specializes in corporate training
solutions, incorporating the company's patented technology to provide video-
and audio-based instruction, scenario-based practice exercises, and
context-aware performance feedback. Viddler is based in Bethlehem, PA, in
the beautiful Lehigh Valley. It has been a challenging and rewarding journey
so far, and for me has become one of those jobs where you look around the
room and realize that this group has become family.

Except for Fargo.

Also, I get to do my favorite things here - build stuff, break stuff, and
fix stuff!

**Previous Positions**

**Systems Administrator - Redbox Instant** November 2012 - March 2014

Redbox Instant, no longer in business, was a streaming video Netflix competitor.
Working in the Ops department, I was part of a team that was responsible
for the uptime of a high availability, cloud based SaaS. Redbox Instant,
or RBI, as we called it, was a project that involved Verizon and Redbox,
with Tekmark providing operational support. RBI was a half a billion dollar
project - I have to say, I'm still surprised they pulled the plug without
getting any return on their investment. I actually thought they had a
pretty good hook, with all the Redbox kiosks around the country.
